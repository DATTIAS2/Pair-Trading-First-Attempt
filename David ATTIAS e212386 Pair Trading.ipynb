        "### ABSTRACT:\n",
        "\n",
        "##### In this notebook, we will try to reproduce the Pair Trading Strategy described by Evan Gatev, William N. Goetzmann and K. Geert Rouwenhorst in their paper Pairs Trading: Performance of a Relative Value Arbitrage Rule, and most specially the version published in 2006.\n",
        "\n",
        "##### We will operate by first defining functions that will allow the user of this notebook to reproduce the Pair Trading Strategy easily on the dataset of their choice.\n",
        "\n",
        "##### The principles of Pair Trading Strategies are easy to understand: finding two assets that move closely together over a period of time, or in Econometrics terms, are \"cointegrated\", and betting, when the spread between the two assets widens beyond a certain threshold, that it will converge back to its mean value.\n",
        "\n",
        "##### The Strategy described in the article initiates trading decisions is trying to be as simplistic as possible in order to underline the large arbitraging opportunities using pair trading from the 1960s to the beginning of the 1990s when they started to decline. Because we didn't manage to find satisfactory data sources detailling the composition of the S&P 500 for past periods, we will content ourselves of using the set of companies listed in the current S&P 500."

With this further step, we would be able to compute Sharpe ratios and compare the application of this strategy over a large pannel of sectors and periods, in order to verify the hypotheses of Gatev, Goetzmann and Rouwenhorst on whether lower SSEs pairs overperformed the others, as well as the role of transaction costs in the decline of the profitability of such strategies, to the profit also of more complex quantitative trading strategies."
